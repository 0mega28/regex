# Regex Engine Implementation in Java

This project focuses on implementing a custom Regex engine. The foundation of the engine follows the principles and design described in the guide [Regex](https://kean.blog/post/regex-parser), originally written in Swift. The goal is to adapt and enhance these concepts while transitioning from Swift to Java, ensuring functionality, performance, and flexibility within the Java environment.
